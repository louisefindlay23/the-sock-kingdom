## The Sock Kingdom - A Vanilla JS Prismic Site

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d863d2e1-da09-46c1-b9a9-cc9bab7a20a1/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/prismic-vanillajs/deploys)

### Purpose

Develop a basic website using Prismic and vanilla JS that uses singleton and repeatable custom types as well as the HTML serializer and group fields.

### About the Website

The Sock Kingdom website contains three blog posts about buying socks which are displayed on the homepage. The HTML serializer was used to render `h2` elements as Pig Latin via the [`piglatin`](https://github.com/montanaflynn/piglatin) module and code snippet field as a `code` element via the codespan custom label.

The website was deployed to [Netlify](https://thesockkingdom.netlify.app) and then Prismic Preview was integrated for both localhost and production environments.

The blog post content was generated via [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) and author profiles using [AI Writer](https://tools.picsart.com/text/ai-writer). All blog post images were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).
